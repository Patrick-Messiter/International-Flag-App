# International Flag Website

This project was firstly intended as a replication of Frontend Mentors REST Countries API Challenge (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca)

The challenge sources an API from (https://restcountries.com/)

I decided to implement my own components in addition to the challenge, including a quiz component.

The quiz component has varying questions with regards to three of the Countries API's keys (Population, Region and Capital).

The project has additionally been hosted using GitHub Pages and can be accessed at (https://patrick-messiter.github.io/International-Flag-App/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
